# Linear Regression Lab

This lab introduces you to linear regression using Python and real-world data. You'll learn how to implement a simple linear regression model to predict revenue based on temperature, visualize your results, and make predictions with your trained model.

## Prerequisites
- A Google account (to use Google Colab)
- Basic Python knowledge (helpful)
- Basic understanding of data science concepts (helpful)

** You will not be required to write Python code. You will need to execute the provided Python code, as instructed

## Setup Instructions

1. **Access the Repository**
   - Go to the provided Git repository URL
   - Download the `notebook.ipynb` file from the `Linear-Regression` directory

2. **Open Google Colab**
   - Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Click `File` ‚Üí `Upload notebook`
   - Upload the `notebook.ipynb` file you downloaded

## Understanding Jupyter Notebooks

A Jupyter notebook contains two types of cells:

1. **Text (Markdown) Cells**
   - Contains explanations, instructions, and theory
   - Formatted text with headers, bullet points, and emphasis
   - No play button - just readable content
   - Double-click to edit, `Shift + Enter` to save changes

2. **Code Cells**
   - Contains Python code you can run
   - Has a play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) on the left
   - Shows output (results, graphs, errors) below the cell
   - Code cells must be run in order, as later cells may depend on variables or functions defined in earlier cells

You can identify cell types by:
- Code cells have a gray background and `[ ]:` on the left
- Text cells have a white background and no `[ ]:` marker
- Code cells have the play button, text cells don't

## Running the Lab

1. **Install Required Libraries**
   - The first code cell will install necessary libraries
   - Run it by clicking the play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) on the left side of the cell
   - Wait for the installation to complete

2. **Run the Notebook**
   - Run each code cell in sequence from top to bottom
   - Click the play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) for each cell or use `Shift + Enter`
   - Wait for each cell to complete before running the next one
   - Look for the small circular indicator next to each cell:
     - ‚ö™ Not yet run
     - üîÑ Currently running
     - ‚úÖ Successfully completed

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Some cells will produce visualizations
   - The prediction section allows you to input different temperatures
   - Modify the `temperature` variable to try different values

## Troubleshooting

- If a cell gives an error, make sure you:
  1. Ran all previous cells in order
  2. Waited for each cell to finish executing
  3. Have a stable internet connection
- If issues persist, try:
  1. Click `Runtime` ‚Üí `Restart runtime`
  2. Run all cells again from the beginning
