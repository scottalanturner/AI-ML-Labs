# Data Breach Logistic Regression Lab

## Overview

This lab introduces fundamental machine learning concepts through logistic regression analysis of data breaches. It is designed for undergraduate students who are new to machine learning, data science and Python programming.

## Getting Started

You will run this lab out of Google Colab, just like the demo lab on Linear Regression. Follow those instructions to load the notebook in Colab.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

These get installed in your notebook.

### Lab Files

- `notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all lab instructions, code, and explanations
- `Data_Breach_Chronology_sample.csv`: Dataset containing information about data breach incidents

## Lab Structure

The Jupyter notebook guides you through:

1. Introduction to logistic regression
2. Data exploration and visualization
3. Data preparation for machine learning
4. Building a logistic regression model
5. Evaluating model performance
6. Interpreting results

## Homework Submission

Submission guidelines are listed at the bottom of the notebook.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:
- Understand the basics of logistic regression
- Learn how to prepare data for machine learning models
- Build and evaluate a simple classification model
- Interpret model results and performance metrics
- Apply machine learning to real-world data breach information
